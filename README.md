In this project, I have used basic HTML to create a recipe website displaying 3 recipes. I used the "a" tag with the "href" attribute to link the pages together, multiple types of heading tags and paragraph tags. I also utilized ordered and unordered lists, as well as visual text editors such as the "b" and "em" tag.

Please note that this was simply for practice and not an actual project
