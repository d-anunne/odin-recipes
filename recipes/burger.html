    <h2><b>AMAZING</b> Smash Burgers!</h2>
    <p>By now we all know that the old piece of burger wisdom "never press on your burger!" is either patently false or, at the very least, wildly inaccurate. Heck, there's an entire successful burger chain devoted to using the technique. While a more traditional griddled burger might be cooked with the goal of a loose, tender texture in mind, a smash burger goes for one thing only: maximum crust.</p>
    <p>See, by placing a ball of meat on a hot, unoiled griddle and smashing it down firmly into a flat, thin disk, you greatly increase the contact points between the meat and the griddle, which in turn increases the Maillard reaction. That's the series of chemical reactions that create the rich brown crust that makes our steaks and burgers taste so freaking good. <b>Maximum crust = maximum flavor = maximum craving.</b></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 soft hamburger roll, <em>buttered and toasted</em></li>
        <li>4 ounces (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two 2-ounce (55g) balls</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 slice good melting cheese, such as American, cheddar</li>
        <li>Condiments and toppings as desired, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>mayonnaise</li>
                <li>mustard</li>
                <li>shredded lettuce</li>
                <li>onions</li>
                <li>tomatoes</li>
                <li>pickles</li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
        <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <p>These burgers cook <b><em>very fast,</em></b> so it's best to make them one at a time. If making multiple burgers, keep them warm under a tent of foil while preparing subsequent burgers.</p>
